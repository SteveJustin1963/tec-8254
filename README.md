The task involves understanding and programming the 8254 Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) using Forth. The 8254 PIT is used for various timing and counting applications in embedded systems. Here’s a detailed explanation and a step-by-step guide on how to use the PIT, along with Forth examples for different configurations:

### Overview of the 8254 PIT
The 8254 PIT has three independent 16-bit counters, each capable of handling clock inputs up to 10 MHz. It operates with a +5V power supply and can be configured via software to operate in different modes. Each counter has:
- A **Clock input**: Receives the clock signal for the counter.
- A **Gate input**: Controls whether the counter is enabled.
- An **Output**: Outputs a signal based on the counter's configuration.

### Modes of Operation
The 8254 PIT can be programmed to operate in various modes:
1. **Mode 0 (Interrupt on Terminal Count)**: Generates an interrupt when the counter reaches zero.
2. **Mode 1 (Hardware Retriggerable One-Shot)**: Generates a pulse when triggered.
3. **Mode 2 (Rate Generator)**: Produces a periodic square wave.
4. **Mode 3 (Square Wave Generator)**: Similar to Mode 2, but with adjustable duty cycle.
5. **Mode 4 (Software Triggered Strobe)**: Produces a single pulse when triggered by software.
6. **Mode 5 (Hardware Triggered Strobe)**: Similar to Mode 4 but triggered by hardware.

### Applications
- Generating accurate time delays
- Event counting
- Generating square waves
- Producing periodic interrupts
- Measuring the duration of an I/O pin’s state

### Example Tasks and Forth-83 Code Implementations

#### 1. Measure Interval Period on an I/O Pin (Example Task)
To measure the interval period of an I/O pin using Counter 0:
- **Initialize the PIT**:
  - Set up Counter 0 in the desired mode (e.g., Mode 1 for a one-shot timer).
  - Connect the clock source and I/O pin (pin 04) as specified.
- **Start the Measurement**:
  - Enable Counter 0 and monitor the output pin (OUT 0).
  - When the measurement is complete, read the counter value.

Here’s a Forth-83 snippet for this task (`read-1.f`):
```forth
: init-8254 ( -- )
  0x34 outb 0x43 ;           \ Set control word for Counter 0, Mode 1 (one-shot), binary mode

: set-count ( n -- )         \ Set the count value for Counter 0
  dup 0x40 outb              \ Write the lower byte to Counter 0
  8 rshift 0x40 outb ;       \ Write the upper byte to Counter 0

: start-measure ( -- )
  init-8254
  65535 set-count ;          \ Example count value

: read-count ( -- n )        \ Read the count value from Counter 0
  0x40 inb                   \ Read the lower byte
  0x40 inb 8 lshift or ;     \ Read the upper byte and combine
```

#### 2. Generate an Interrupt Using the 8254
The 8254 can be set up to generate periodic interrupts. Here’s a Forth-83 snippet to configure the PIT (`int-1.f`):
```forth
: init-int ( -- )
  0x36 outb 0x43 ;           \ Set control word for Counter 0, Mode 2 (Rate Generator), binary mode

: set-freq ( n -- )          \ Set the frequency count for the interrupt
  dup 0x40 outb              \ Write the lower byte to Counter 0
  8 rshift 0x40 outb ;       \ Write the upper byte to Counter 0

: start-int ( -- )
  init-int
  65535 set-freq ;           \ Set the counter value to trigger at regular intervals

: read-int-status ( -- n )   \ Read status of Counter 0
  0x40 inb ;
```
- This code configures Counter 0 as a rate generator (Mode 2) to generate periodic interrupts. The frequency count can be set using the `set-freq` word.

#### 3. Measure the Duration of an I/O Pin’s State
To measure the duration for which an I/O pin remains high or low:
- **Configure the PIT**: Set up a counter (e.g., Counter 2) in a suitable mode (Mode 5) to use the gate input.
- **Connect the I/O Pin**: Connect the pin to the gate input of Counter 2.
- **Start the Measurement**: Monitor the gate and read the counter value.

Here’s a Forth-83 snippet for this task (`dur-1.f`):
```forth
: init-dur ( -- )
  0x38 outb 0x43 ;           \ Set control word for Counter 2, Mode 5 (Hardware Strobe), binary mode

: set-max-count ( -- )
  0xFF 0x42 outb             \ Set maximum count value (low byte)
  0xFF 0x42 outb ;           \ Set maximum count value (high byte)

: start-dur ( -- )
  init-dur
  set-max-count ;

: read-dur ( -- n )          \ Read the counter value after the measurement
  0x42 inb                   \ Read the lower byte
  0x42 inb 8 lshift or ;     \ Read the upper byte and combine
```

### Additional Notes
- The `outb` and `inb` words represent output and input operations to hardware ports. Adjust these based on your Forth environment's syntax and hardware specifics.
- Ensure the I/O pin configuration matches the hardware setup. The 8254 PIT uses gate inputs to control counting, so make sure the appropriate pin is connected.
- The counter values and control words should be configured based on the operating mode and the function you intend to implement (e.g., generating an interrupt or measuring a duration).
