### Overview of the 8254 PIT
The 8254 PIT has three independent 16-bit counters, each capable of handling clock inputs up to 10 MHz. It operates with a +5V power supply and can be configured via software to operate in different modes. Each counter has:
- A **Clock input**: Receives the clock signal for the counter.
- A **Gate input**: Controls whether the counter is enabled.
- An **Output**: Outputs a signal based on the counter's configuration.

### Modes of Operation
The 8254 PIT can be programmed to operate in various modes:
1. **Mode 0 (Interrupt on Terminal Count)**: Generates an interrupt when the counter reaches zero.
2. **Mode 1 (Hardware Retriggerable One-Shot)**: Generates a pulse when triggered.
3. **Mode 2 (Rate Generator)**: Produces a periodic square wave.
4. **Mode 3 (Square Wave Generator)**: Similar to Mode 2, but with adjustable duty cycle.
5. **Mode 4 (Software Triggered Strobe)**: Produces a single pulse when triggered by software.
6. **Mode 5 (Hardware Triggered Strobe)**: Similar to Mode 4 but triggered by hardware.

### Applications
- Generating accurate time delays
- Event counting
- Generating square waves
- Producing periodic interrupts
- Measuring the duration of an I/O pinâ€™s state
