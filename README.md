### Overview of the 8254 PIT
The 8254 PIT has three independent 16-bit counters, each capable of handling clock inputs up to 10 MHz. It operates with a +5V power supply and can be configured via software to operate in different modes. Each counter has:
- A **Clock input**: Receives the clock signal for the counter.
- A **Gate input**: Controls whether the counter is enabled.
- An **Output**: Outputs a signal based on the counter's configuration.

### Modes of Operation
The 8254 PIT can be programmed to operate in various modes:
1. **Mode 0 (Interrupt on Terminal Count)**: Generates an interrupt when the counter reaches zero.
2. **Mode 1 (Hardware Retriggerable One-Shot)**: Generates a pulse when triggered.
3. **Mode 2 (Rate Generator)**: Produces a periodic square wave.
4. **Mode 3 (Square Wave Generator)**: Similar to Mode 2, but with adjustable duty cycle.
5. **Mode 4 (Software Triggered Strobe)**: Produces a single pulse when triggered by software.
6. **Mode 5 (Hardware Triggered Strobe)**: Similar to Mode 4 but triggered by hardware.

### Applications
- Generating accurate time delays
- Event counting
- Generating square waves
- Producing periodic interrupts
- Measuring the duration of an I/O pinâ€™s state

### Example Tasks and Forth-83 Code Implementations

#### 1. Measure Interval Period on an I/O Pin (Example Task)
To measure the interval period of an I/O pin using Counter 0:
- **Initialize the PIT**:
  - Set up Counter 0 in the desired mode (e.g., Mode 1 for a one-shot timer).
  - Connect the clock source and I/O pin (pin 04) as specified.
- **Start the Measurement**:
  - Enable Counter 0 and monitor the output pin (OUT 0).
  - When the measurement is complete, read the counter value.

### Read-1 mint
### Interrupt int-1 mint
### Measure Duration
To measure the duration for which an I/O pin remains high or low:
- **Configure the PIT**: Set up a counter (e.g., Counter 2) in a suitable mode (Mode 5) to use the gate input.
- **Connect the I/O Pin**: Connect the pin to the gate input of Counter 2.
- **Start the Measurement**: Monitor the gate and read the counter value.

### Additional Notes
- The `outb` and `inb` words represent output and input operations to hardware ports. Adjust these based on your Forth environment's syntax and hardware specifics.
- Ensure the I/O pin configuration matches the hardware setup. The 8254 PIT uses gate inputs to control counting, so make sure the appropriate pin is connected.
- The counter values and control words should be configured based on the operating mode and the function you intend to implement (e.g., generating an interrupt or measuring a duration).
