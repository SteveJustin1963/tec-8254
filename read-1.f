 

1. Initialize the 8254 chip:
   - Set the appropriate control word to select Counter 0.
   - Configure Counter 0 as a one-shot timer with a 16-bit binary count mode.

2. Set up the clock source for Counter 0:
   - Connect the clock input (CLK 0) to the external clock source or another appropriate clock signal.

3. Configure the Gate input:
   - Connect the Gate input (GATE 0) to I/O pin 04.

4. Start the measurement:
   - Enable Counter 0 by setting the appropriate control word.

5. Wait for the measurement to complete:
   - Monitor the status of the Counter 0 output (OUT 0).
   - When OUT 0 goes high, the measurement has completed.

6. Read the measurement result:
   - Read the count value from Counter 0, which represents the interval period.

Here's a Forth-83 code snippet to accomplish this:

```forth
\ Constants for 8254 control words
\ Control word for Counter 0: 16-bit binary, one-shot mode
16 CONSTANT CONTROL_WORD_C0
CONTROL_WORD_C0 CONSTANT CONTROL_WORD_ADDRESS

\ Port addresses
27 CONSTANT PORT_ADDRESS

\ Function to write a value to a port
: OUT PORT_ADDRESS OUT ! ;

\ Function to set the control word for Counter 0
: INIT_8254
  CONTROL_WORD_ADDRESS CONTROL_WORD_C0 OUT
;

\ Function to start the measurement
: START_MEASUREMENT
  \ Connect the clock input (CLK 0) to your desired clock source
  \ Configure the Gate input (GATE 0) to I/O pin 04
  \ Enable Counter 0 using the CONTROL_WORD_C0
  INIT_8254
;

\ Function to wait for measurement completion
: WAIT_FOR_MEASUREMENT
  BEGIN
    \ Check the status of the Counter 0 output (OUT 0)
    PORT_ADDRESS IN @ 1 AND 0= IF
      EXIT
    THEN
  AGAIN
;

\ Function to read the measurement result
: READ_MEASUREMENT
  \ Read the count value from Counter 0
  CONTROL_WORD_ADDRESS 1 + PORT_ADDRESS IN @
;

\ Main program
START_MEASUREMENT
WAIT_FOR_MEASUREMENT
READ_MEASUREMENT .
```

This code initializes the 8254 chip, starts the measurement, waits for it to complete, and then reads and displays the measurement result. You'll need to connect the clock source and I/O pin 04 as specified in your hardware setup.
